        <h2>Hi, I'm Katie Stoltz</h2>
        <p>I'm a software developer passionate about the evolving landscape where software engineering meets AI innovation. With experience in both traditional development and emerging AI technologies, I created <b>Stoltz Stack</b> to explore how artificial intelligence is transforming the way we build software.</p>
        <p>My journey in tech has given me a front-row seat to the rapid evolution from manual coding to AI-assisted development. Through this blog, I share insights, tutorials, and perspectives on AI tools, machine learning systems, and the changing practices of software engineering.</p>

        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>After graduating college, I began my career at a cybersecurity startup where I quickly rose to the position of CTO. This experience gave me invaluable insights into security-minded development practices and the critical intersection of software reliability and protection against threats.</p>
        <p>As AI technologies began transforming the development landscape, I made the decision to pivot my career toward AI development. This transition allowed me to combine my security background with cutting-edge AI tools and methodologies, giving me a unique perspective on how these technologies can work together to create more robust software solutions.</p>
        <p>Today, I'm focused on exploring how AI is reshaping the software engineering discipline while maintaining the security principles that have guided my career from the beginning. Through <b>Stoltz Stack</b>, I aim to share these experiences and insights with the broader developer community.</p>
